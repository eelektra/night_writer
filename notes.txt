ARGV is an array
message_file = File.open(ARGV[0], "r")
new_file = File.new(ARGV[1], "w")
new_file.write(message)
message_file.read
new_file.write("all the text you want")

braille.txt (msg converted to braille)

Missed this bullet in iteration 1:  • braille.txt is the name that we would like to give to a file that we will create in iteration 2.
 
message.txt (what user wants to convert)

take in message.txt then translate message.txt to braille.  Braille.txt is a file created by your runner file (night_writer) and contains the translated braille message.

make the translation work first, then build your objects and methods

 1-take in a file and then output a file
 2-make a hash where letters are keys and braille is output
 3-translate 1 letter to braille
 4-translate several characters
 5 - spec files (tests), classes (init, methods), runner(night_writer.rb)

we created a var and opened a file we created
file = File.open(ARG[0], "r")
text = file.read
file.close

change the text 
capitalized = text.upcase
writer = File.open(ARGV[1], "w")
writer.write(capitalized)
writer.close
